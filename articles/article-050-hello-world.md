The first piece of code you usually find in a programming book or tutorial is a "Hello World!" program. The purpose of this program is to display the text "Hello World!". Since it is rather easy to write a program to print text, one can familiarize themselves with the basics of a programming in a certain language. Due to this tradition, these are usually the first lines of code a programmer writes in their life.
