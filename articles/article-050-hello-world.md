The first piece of code you usually find in a programming book or tutorial is a "Hello World!" program. The purpose of this program is to display the text "Hello World!". Because this is rather simple for nearly all programming languages, it is a good example to see the basic concepts of a programming language. Due to this tradition, these are usually the first lines of code a programmer writes in their live.
