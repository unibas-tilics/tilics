# Game of life
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
John Horton Conway invented a simple game with a small amount of rules. 
Each cell on a square grid is either dead or alive. For each iteration the cell looks at it 8 neighbors.
If it has less than two living neighbors it dies of loneliness, if it has more then 3 neighbors it dies of overpopulation. If it has exactly 3 neigbors it turns alive.
Those rules are quite simple but the possibilities of interesting simulation are enormous. It is Turing complete and simulating it is often used to show Turing completeness of something else.
