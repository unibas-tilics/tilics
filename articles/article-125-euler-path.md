# How to navigate in Königsberg
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
The city of Königsberg is split by a river into 4 land masses. Those are connected by 7 lovely bridges that invite to a walk. The best route is of course the one which crosses each bridge exactly once.
But what is this route? Leonard Euler showed with graphtheory that unfortunately no such route exists in Königsberg.
