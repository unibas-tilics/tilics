# Why Uptime Matters
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
The time since a computer was started is referred to as its
**uptime**.  When the computer is rebooted (or crashes), its uptime is
reset to zero.  The time the computer is not running is called
**downtime**.

When running a **service**, such as a website, we want it to be
available at all times.  This means that the **server** the website is
running on has to be available all the time.  As a high uptime means
that a server has been running a long time without interruption, it
can indicate that the provided services are also available with few
interruptions.
