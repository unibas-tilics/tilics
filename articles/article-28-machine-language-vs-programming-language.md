<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
A programming language is a high-level language that programmers can write, read and understand. There are many programming languages such as Java, C++, Fortran, and many more.

A machine language is a low-level language that the machines can read, and understand. It is just one language which is a stream of 0's & 1's.

In between, there is a compiler which is a computer program that can understand both languages high-/low-level languages and interpret one to another.
