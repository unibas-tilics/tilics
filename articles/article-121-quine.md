What could be easier than to write a program that produces its own
code as output?

It’s not that easy – even a well-versed programmer will need to spend
some hours to figure out the trick (which can be different for each
programming language).

One trick is that the program must contain a description of itself,
inside its own code. Because outputting the self-description also
needs code, the self-description must be somehow compressed.

But once written, such a program --also called a "Quine"-- reproduces
itself each time it is run, and this in turn is called a fixpoint.
One could call this the fixpoint of life because any lifeform
(including robots) must master this trick if they wanted to build
themselves.
