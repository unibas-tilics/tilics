# CamelCase, or why coding conventions matter

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
One problem that often arises when writing code is the naming of variables. Often multi-word names are used for variables, but in most programming languages it is not possible to use spaces in a variable name. One programming style that tries to structure this is called CamelCase. It is the practice of writing each word in the middle of a phrase with a capital letter.
