# Is x a more powerful programming language than y?

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
There are hundreds or even thousands of programming languages, but are all of these equally powerful, i.e. can they be used to compute an arbitrary problem? The answer is yes--if the language is Turing complete.

A programming language is called Turing complete if it can be used to simulate a Turing machine. Because the Turing machine is able to compute everything that is computable, a Turing complete language is therefore equally powerful.

Most of the commonly used programming languages are Turing complete. But there are some well-known domain specific languages that are not. However, Turing completeness says nothing regarding the performance or the ease of use.

There are examples of one-instruction languages that are Turing complete, for example the x86 mov operator.
