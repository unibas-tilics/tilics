# "Brute Force" means you are weak

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
For some problems in Computer Science, it can be proven that there are
no "efficient" ways of solving them. In this case, the only resort is
**brute force**. Brute force means that you let the computer try out
every possible --and we really mean _every_ single, possible and
potential-- value that solves the problem, until you succeed.

Several cryptographic algorithms are based on such problems where the
secret key can only be guessed or found by exhaustively trying
out all possible values during a few billion years. Confronted with
such time scales, attackers find themselves in a very weak position.
