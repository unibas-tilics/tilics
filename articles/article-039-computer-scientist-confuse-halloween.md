<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
A computer stores everything with 1s and 0s. To encode any number as a String of 1s and 0s you use the binary system. It is similar to the deciaml system normal humans use but it has only two figures 1 and 0. In decimal you have the base 10 and can rewrite the number 1337_dec as 1*10^3+3*10^2+3*10^1+7*10^0. In binary the number 1101_bin can be representet as 1*2^3+1*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0=13_dec. the are also other systems like hexadecimal with the 16 figures 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,E,F and the octal system with the figures from 0 to 7. To get from one system to the other you devide by the base with remainder until you reach 0. Then you string the remainders backwards together.

Don't worry. The 101 in the title was in decimal. We are not done yet.
