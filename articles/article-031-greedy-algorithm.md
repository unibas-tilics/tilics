A very intuitive approach lies at the bottom of so called *greedy algorithms*: At every step of the problem, do what looks best *at that moment*. To imagine this, think about how you hand out change. To be done with it quickly, you try to deal with as few coins as possible. First, you pick the most valuable coin that covers most of the amount. Then you pick the second largest valued coin of the remaining change. And so on. You‘ll most definitely be done faster than if you just started assembling random coins.

In such simple cases, a greedy approach might work well. However, as soon as the problem gets a little more complicated, the greedy algorithm will most certainly not find the best of solution. Instead, it might make too hasty decisions and end up on the wrong path. Because sometimes, in order to find the best solution, you have to plan ahead further than one step. Or even take a step back from time to time.
