# Title: Local vs Global Variables
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Local variables are like short-term memoriesâ€”useful within their function but forgotten after. Global variables, however, persist across the entire program. Know when to use each to keep your code clean, efficient and secure. It's like data roaming: with roaming (global variable), you can make calls from any country, but without it (local variable), you're limited to your home network and can't make calls abroad.
