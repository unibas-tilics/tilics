# How a 'pipeline' can run computer instructions faster

Imagine you and two friends are having a party, and each of you wants to prepare a different meal in a kitchen equipped with a cutting board, a pan, and an oven. If each person cooks their dish sequentially, waiting for the previous one to finish, much of the kitchen equipment will be idle, leading to inefficiency.

To improve efficiency, the first friend starts chopping on the cutting board and then uses the pan. While she cooks, the second friend can begin on the cutting board. As the first friend places her dish in the oven, the second can continue using the pan, and the third can start on the cutting board. This cooking pipeline allows all three friends to use the kitchen equipment simultaneously, minimizing idle time.

Similarly, a CPU pipeline breaks tasks into smaller steps that run concurrently. While one instruction is executed, another is fetched, and a third is decoded, enhancing efficiency and allowing for faster overall performance.
