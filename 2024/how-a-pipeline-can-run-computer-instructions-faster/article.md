# How a 'pipeline' can run computer instructions faster

Imagine you and your friends are having a party and want to prepare several meals. Cooking each dish one at a time takes hours, but by setting up a cooking pipeline—where everyone has a specific task like chopping vegetables or preparing sauces—you can work simultaneously and speed up the process.

Similarly, a CPU pipeline breaks tasks into smaller steps that run at the same time. While one instruction is executed, another is fetched, and a third is decoded, just like teamwork in a kitchen.
