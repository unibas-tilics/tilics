# How a 'pipeline' can run computer instructions faster

In the early days of manufacturing, each worker was responsible for the entire production process of a product. Later, in the early 20th century, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line for car production, revolutionizing the automotive industry. He divided the production process into specialized tasks, allowing workers to focus on a single part of the assembly. Conveyor belts enabled cars to move efficiently between workstations, allowing multiple stages of production to happen at once and greatly reducing production time and costs.

Just as the assembly line allows multiple stages of production to occur simultaneously, pipelining enables a computer to process multiple instructions at different stages of execution at the same time. Each instruction moves through stages like fetching, decoding, executing, and writing back results. Initially, the first instruction is fetched. When it moves to decoding, the fetch unit can retrieve the second instruction. As the second instruction is decoded, the third is fetched while the first is executing. By the next step, the first instruction writes back its results, the other two shift one stage, and the fourth instruction is fetched. From then on, one instruction enters the pipeline and another exits at each step. Pipelining minimizes idle time and maximizes throughput, leading to faster program execution.

However, pipelines can introduce complexities, such as managing data dependencies and potential hazards when instructions rely on each other. Despite these challenges, the benefits of pipelining are clear: it allows computers to operate more quickly and efficiently, making everyday tasks—like browsing the internet or streaming videos—smoother and faster.
