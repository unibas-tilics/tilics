# Divide and Conquer: Solving Problems in Steps
Imagine cleaning a messy room. You divide it into sections like desk, bed, floor. Clean each section one by one. This makes the task manageable and efficient.

This is called "divide and conquer" strategy which is widely used in algorithms. For example, in merge sort, a list is repeatedly divided into smaller sublists. Each sublist is sorted individually, and the sorted parts are merged back into a complete, ordered list.

"Divide and conquer" simplifies big problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable steps. Divide to simplify, conquer step by step!
