# Divide and Conquer: Solving Problems in Steps
Imagine we decide to clean a messy room. To make it more efficiently, we can divide it into sections like the desk, bed, and floor. Clean each section one by one, and the whole room will be tidy.

"Divide and conquer" is a strategy where big problems are broken into smaller parts to solve more easily. Although this sounds simple, it is highly effective in algorithms. For example, quicksort uses this idea to sort items. It picks a "pivot," splits items into two groups (smaller and larger), sorts each group, then merges the results.

Divide to simplify, conquer step by step!
