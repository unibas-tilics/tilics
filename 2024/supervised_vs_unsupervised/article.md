# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: Two Approaches to Teaching AI

Supervised and unsupervised learning represent two unique paths in teaching AI to understand data. In supervised learning, AI learns from labeled examples, much like studying with an answer key, helping it classify or predict with accuracy. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is more like exploring a mystery box. AI searches for patterns or clusters within unlabeled data, discovering insights on its own. One learns through guidance, the other through exploration, each method unlocking different strengths for AI applications.
