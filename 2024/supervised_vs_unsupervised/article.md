# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: Two Approaches to Teach AI

Supervised and unsupervised learning represent two unique paths in teaching AI to understand data. 
In supervised learning, AI learns from examples, much like studying with the question and the answer. For instance, think of an AI learning to recognize cats by studying pictures already labeled as "cat" or "not cat."
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, is more like exploring a mystery box; AI searches for patterns or clusters within unlabeled data, discovering insights on its own, such as identifying different customer groups based on purchasing behaviors. One learns through guidance, the other through exploration, each method unlocking different strengths for AI applications.
