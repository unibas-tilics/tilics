# Art of Knowing When to Stop (Optimization)

Imagine you’re perfecting a recipe, just like Sam, a baker who kept adjusting his bread recipe. Early changes improved the bread, but later tweaks didn’t make it taste any better—they only made the recipe more complicated. Sam discovered that the best version wasn’t the most complex one; it was the one that balanced simplicity and taste.

This same idea applies when you optimize data or models. There’s a “sweet spot” between being too basic and adding too many bells and whistles. Sometimes, extra refinements use up a lot of time, energy, and resources without providing real improvements. True optimization means making changes that genuinely add value or help maintain performance, without overcomplicating your system. In other words, know when to stop—just like Sam did with his bread.
