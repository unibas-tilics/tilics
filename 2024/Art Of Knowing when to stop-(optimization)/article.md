# Art of Knowing When to Stop (Optimization)
Think of optimization like perfecting a recipe: A baker named Sam kept
adjusting his bread recipe to make it better.At first, small changes improved
the bread, but when he changed too much, it actually got worse.
He learned that the best version wasn't necessarily the most complex one.

This same principle applies to programming â€“ there's a "sweet spot" between
code that's too basic and code that's unnecessarily complex. True optimization
means making smart improvements that actually add value, while knowing when
to stop before changes become counterproductive. The key is finding the right
balance, just like Sam did with his bread.
