# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are both AI methods, but they differ in complexity and applications. ML uses algorithms to learn from data, often requiring human-defined features and working well with smaller, structured datasets. Itâ€™s ideal for simpler tasks like predictive analytics.

DL, a subset of ML, uses neural networks to automatically learn from large, unstructured datasets. It excels in complex tasks like image and speech recognition but requires more data and computational power.

In short, ML is best for simpler problems, while DL handles larger, more intricate challenges.
