# Travelling Salesman Problem

At first glance, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) seems simple: given a list of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the starting point?

But here is the catch: as the number of cities increases, the problem becomes exponentially harder. For example, with 3 cities, there are only 2 possible routes. With 11 cities, there are 19,958,400 possibilities! For 20 cities, the number is so huge it is practically impossible to calculate all the routes one by one.

TSP is called an NP-hard problem. This means that currently we know no way to find the shortest route. We can easily check if a route works, but figuring out the best one takes an enormous amount of time.

The Travelling Salesman Problem is not just a puzzle - it is a challenge that pushes the boundaries of computer science. Researchers are constantly striving to find better ways to solve it, as even small improvements can lead to significant breakthroughs in optimization and efficiency. It remains one of the most intriguing and difficult problems in the field.
