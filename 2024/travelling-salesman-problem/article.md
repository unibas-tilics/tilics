# Travelling Salesman Problem

At first glance, the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) seems simple: given a list of cities and their distances to one another, what is the shortest possible route for visiting each city once and returning to the starting point?

But here is the catch: as the number of cities increases, the problem becomes harder exponentially. For example, with three cities, there are only two possible routes. With 11 cities, there are 19,958,400 possibilities! For 20 cities, the number is so huge it is practically impossible to calculate all the routes one by one.

TSP is called an NP-hard problem. This means that we currently cannot solve it. We can check if a route works, but figuring out the best one takes an enormous amount of time.

The Travelling Salesman Problem is not just a puzzle - it is a challenge that pushes the boundaries of computer science. Researchers are striving to find better ways to solve it, as even small improvements can lead to significant breakthroughs in optimization and efficiency. It remains one of the most intriguing and difficult problems in the field.
