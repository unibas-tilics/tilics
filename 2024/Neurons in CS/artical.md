#Neurons in CS 

In computer science, artificial neurons are the fundamental building blocks of artificial neural networks (ANNs), designed to mimic the function 
of biological neurons in the human brain. These networks come in many shapes and sizes

Imagine a group of people on a voting committee trying to make a decision:

The first group of committee members (neurons) receives information (inputs) and votes on it, such as "yes" or "no."
Their decisions are passed to the next group of members (hidden layer), which analyzes the combined votes, applies further criteria, and makes 
additional decisions.

This process can continue through multiple groups of members (hidden layers), where each layer refines and processes the information further.

Finally, the last group of committee members (output layer) tallies the refined decisions from the hidden layers and delivers the overall result, 
such as a single "yes" or "no," or a specific choice like selecting a category or predicting a value.
