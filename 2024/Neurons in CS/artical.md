#Neural Networks in CS 

The human brain processes information, learns and makes decisions by using billions of interconnected neurons. 
Inspired by this, artificial neural networks (ANNs) use artificial neurons to solve tasks like recognizing speech or diagnosing medical conditions. 
A voting committee offers a useful analogy for how these networks function. ANNs consists of 3 Layers, in Input layer members of the commitee (neurons) receive information, like face or suggestions. Each piece of information is given a weight based on its importance. Hidden layer/s, these members analyze refine the information, looking for patterns to make better decisions. Output layer makes the final decision, such as identifying an object in a picture or answering a question.
To make the network smarter, training adjusts how much weight each piece of information gets. Over time, just like the brain improves with practice, the network learns from its data and becomes more accurate.
