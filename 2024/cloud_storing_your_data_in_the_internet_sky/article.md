# Cloud - Storing your data in the internet sky

Imagine you have important photos or documents but don’t want to risk losing them if your device breaks. Instead of keeping them on your computer, you store them in “the Cloud.” Think of the Cloud as a virtual locker on the internet where your data is safe and accessible from any device. It’s like having a personal storage space in the sky that you can reach anytime, anywhere.

Storing your data in the Cloud is like having a secure, always accessible digital safe that keeps your information protected and available whenever you need it.
