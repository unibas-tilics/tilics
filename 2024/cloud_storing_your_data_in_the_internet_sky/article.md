# Cloud - Storing your data in the internet sky

Imagine you have important photos or documents but don’t want to risk losing them if your device breaks. Instead of keeping them on your computer, you store them in “the Cloud”. Think of the Cloud as a virtual locker on the internet where your data is safe and accessible from any device. It’s like having a personal storage space in the sky that you can reach anytime, anywhere.

But how safe is it? Your data is stored somehwere on a server, so you need to make sure that your information is protected and that the service doesn’t share the data without your consent.

Storing your data in the Cloud it's convenient for backup, collaboration, and accessing files on multiple devices, but you need to consider security, reliability, cost, and privacy when choosing a cloud service.
