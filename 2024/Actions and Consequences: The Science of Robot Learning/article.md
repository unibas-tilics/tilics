#Actions and Consequences: The Science of Robot Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a way of teaching computers or robots to learn by trying things out and improving based on feedback. The system takes an action and gets a reward if the action was good or a penalty if it was bad. Over time, it learns to choose actions that get the most rewards and avoid penalties. This method helps it figure out the best way to solve a problem by learning from its own successes and mistakes.
