# Indentation: the invisible code keeper

Imagine you're baking a chocolate cake. The recipe is laid out step by step, with clear spacing and groupings to show which instructions belong together. This structure makes the recipe easy to follow.

In programming, indentation works the same way. By adding spaces at the start of each line of code, programmers create a visual hierarchy that shows how different parts of the "code recipe" relate to one another.

Why is this important? 
A recipe without clear grouping is much harder to follow, right? The same goes for code. Indentation makes it clear and easy to understand, both for the programmer and others reading it.

Think of it this way: good indentation is like a well-organized recipe â€“ it helps everyone see what belongs where!
