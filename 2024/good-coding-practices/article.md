# What makes code good?

You might think that good code is characterized by the fact that it works.
But code is not only written for machines, it is also written for humans, who have to read and revise it.
Therefore, *good* code is easy to read, easy to reuse, and well organized.

There are many principles that help programmers write good code. 
Like **KISS**, which means "Keep it simple, stupid!". 
A programmer remembering this principle, will not devise a "clever" or complex solution, if there exists a simpler one working just as well. 

There's also **DRY**, aka "Don't repeat yourself". 
This principle warns to not write duplicate code or store redundant data. 
Having the same information in several places, often leads to inconsistencies when the information changes but is not updated everywhere.
