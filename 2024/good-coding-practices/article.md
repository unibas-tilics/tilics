# What makes code good?

You might think that good code is characterized by the fact that it works.
But most code is not written once and never touched again; in reality  
existing code often has to be adapted and maintained to fit changing requirements.
Therefore, *good* code is also easy to read, easy to reuse, and well organized.

There are many principles stating good habits when writing code. 
Like **KISS**, which means "keep it simple, stupid". 
KISS states that there is no benefit in devising a "clever" or complex solution if a simple one works just as well. 
Another example is **DRY**, aka "don't repeat yourself". 
Duplication and redundancy in code and when storing data should be avoided since duplication will likely lead to inconsistencies if not everything is updated correctly.
