# What makes code good?

Code is more than just instructions for machines; it’s a shared language for humans. 
Good code does not only ensure that your program runs, it allows collaboration by ensuring that every person who interacts with it — the original author, a colleague, or even someone years later — can understand it.
But writing code that is easy to understand and well organized is not always easy.

For this reason many principles exist, which help programmers write good code. 
**KISS** means "Keep it simple, stupid!" and reminds programmers to not devise overly complex solutions for simple problems.
Or **DRY** meaning "Do not repeat yourself", so that code does not become cluttered and redundant. 
These principles do not only apply to writing code. 
Avoiding complexity to favor clarity is good advice for your daily life as well!
