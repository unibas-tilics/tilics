## What is a URL?

The address of a distinct online resource is known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This technique is one of the main ways web browsers retrieve internet resources, including HTML pages, Styling documents, pictures, and more.

To put it another way, a URL can be thought of as a regular postal mail address, with the route representing the building where our mail should be delivered, the parameters representing additional information like the apartment number in the building, the anchor representing the actual person to whom we have addressed our mail, the scheme representing the postal service we wish to use, the domain name representing the city or town, and the port representing the ZIP code.
