# Hackers: White Hat VS Black Hat VS Grey Hat

We all know what hackers are. Their hats show what they like to do!

A White Hat is like a good detective who gets hired to fix problems and keep everyone safe.  
A Black Hat is like a sneaky thief who tries to break things or steal.   
While a Gray Hat is a mix of both worlds. They aren’t trying to hurt anyone, but they don’t always follow the rules. They find problems, like a loose door in a house, and then, instead of telling the owner how they broke into the house, they offer to repair and secure the house, but they didn’t get permission to check first!
