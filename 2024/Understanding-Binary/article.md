    # Understanding Binary - The language of computers

    Computers work like tiny switches—each switch can be **on** (1) or **off** (0). This on-off system is called **binary**, and it’s how all information, from text to pictures, is stored.

*   **Bit:** A single 0 or 1 is called a _bit_—the smallest unit of data.
*   **Byte:** A group of 8 bits makes a _byte_, which can represent letters, colors, or sounds.

**Counting in Binary:** Just like we count from 0 to 9, computers count with 0 and 1.
Example: Imagine spelling “A” using 8 light switches. The pattern **01000001** represents "A" in binary. Computers read these patterns to interpret data!
