# The language of computers

Have you ever wondered how computers "think"? At their core, computers consist of countless tiny switches that can be either on or off. This simple system is called binary. It is the foundation of how computers store and process information.

Binary is like a language with only two "words": 0 and 1. By combining these, computers can represent anything, from text to images.
The smallest binary unit is a bit, representing a single switch that can be either on (1) or off (0). A group of 8 bits forms a byte. A byte is enough to represent something meaningful, like a letter, a number, or even a small color value.

In essence, bits and bytes are the building blocks of binary, allowing computers to represent and process all the information we see - whether it's text, numbers, images, or colors.
