# What Supermarkets Can Teach Us About Data Structure?
<!-- END TITLE -->




<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Imagine in a supermarket, Customers line up to pay, with the first to join being served first. New arrivals join the end of the line, ensuring an orderly process. In computer science, this is called **'queues'**, following the 'First In, First Out' (FIFO) rule.

After shopping, customers generally place their baskets in a pile at the entrance. In general, the next customer takes the top basket, meaning the last one placed is taken first. In computer science, this is called **'stacks'**, following the 'Last In, First Out' (LIFO) rule.

Programmers use stacks and queues to organize data efficiently. Queues handle tasks in arrival order, while stacks process tasks in reverse order of their addition.
