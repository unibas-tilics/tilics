# Compiled vs Interpreted Languages 

Ever wondered how computers execute programming languages? Think of it like dining out.

Compiled languages are like ordering fast food. The meals (code) are prepared in advance. When it’s time to eat (execute), everything is served instantly. But if you want to change your order, you’ll need to restart the whole process.

Interpreted languages are like teppanyaki cooking, where the chef prepares your dish step-by-step in front of you. It’s slower but flexible—you can adjust as you go. 

Both have their uses—it just depends on what you need: speed or flexibility.
