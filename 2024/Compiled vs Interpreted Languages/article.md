# Compiled vs Interpreted Languages 

Ever wondered how computers execute programming languages? Think of it like dining out.

Code written in compiled languages is translated into machine code before execution. It’s like ordering fast food: the menu (code) is prepped and packaged in advance. When it’s time to eat (execute), the meal is ready instantly. But if you want to change your order, you’ll need to start the whole process over.

Code written in interpreted languages are translated into machine code during execution, line by line.   It’s like teppanyaki cooking, where the chef prepares your dish step-by-step as you watch. It’s flexible—you can adjust midway—but it takes longer than pre-prepared meals. 

So, what’s your preference? Speed and efficiency? Or adaptability and spontaneity? Either way, both flavors have their place in the world of computing!
