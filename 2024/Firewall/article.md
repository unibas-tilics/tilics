# The Firewall

Imagine you live in a house with a strong, secure front door. 
To secure your home, you set up a list of rules:
People you know can knock and come in, some people - for example, delivery people - can leave packages but cannot enter the house and everyone else is not permitted to enter at all.

If someone tries to come inside, you can stop them at the door, check who they are, and decide whether to let them in. 
This keeps your home safe from unwanted visitors.

A firewall works just like your front door. 
It's there to protect your network by checking who's trying to get in and only allowing trusted data to enter. 
In a very good setup, the firewall even remembers previous interactions, allowing it to make smarter decisions about who to let in.
If something suspicious tries to slip in without permission, the firewall blocks it, 
just like you would close the door on an unexpected stranger.
