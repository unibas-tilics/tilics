# The Burning Wall that Protects your Home

Imagine you live in a house with a strong, secure front door. 
To secure your home, you set up a list of rules:

- Friends and family can knock on the door and come in if you recognize them.
- Delivery people can leave packages, but they're not allowed inside.
- Strangers who aren't expected are turned away.

If a person you don't recognize tries to come inside. 
Because of your rules, you can stop them at the door, check who they are, and decide wether to let them in. 
This keeps your home safe from unwanted visitors.

A firewall works just like your front door. 
It's there to protect your network by checking who's trying to get in and only allowing trusted data to enter. 
If something suspicious tries to slip in without permission, the firewall blocks it, 
just like you would close the door on an unexpected stranger.
