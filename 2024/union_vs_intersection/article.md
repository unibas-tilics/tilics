# Union vs. Intersection of sets of objects - "include, exclude, what?" 

In the context of mathematical foundations in Computer Science, set theory is a fundamental concept. The concept of a set - an unordered collection of unique objects (without duplicates) - can help to clarify and simplify algorithm design. Let's look at an example:

We have two sets, S1 and S2. Set S1 contains only one object, the object hair. Set S2 contains two objects, the object glasses and the object hair. We denote a set in braces {} and divide the objects with commas.

The union (U) of two sets contains all objects in either set or both. In our example, the union of S1 and S2 (S1 U S2) is therefore {hair, glasses}.
The intersection of two sets contains only the mutual objects. In our example, the intersection of S1 and S2 is {hair}, as both S1 and S2 contain the object hair.
