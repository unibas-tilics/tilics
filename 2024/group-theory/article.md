Let's start by recalling that the way we normally add numbers—where 2 + 2 always equals 4 — is just one example of a mathematical system. In school, we learn arithmetic, which is built on a set of rules (or axioms) that everyone agrees to follow. However, in abstract algebra, mathematicians study all kinds of systems with their own rules. These systems are defined by a set of axioms, and as long as those rules are followed, everything in the system is perfectly consistent — even if it looks very different from what you’re used to.

Group theory is a branch of abstract algebra that studies sets of elements together with an operation that follows simple rules, like having an identity element and a way to "undo" the operation. It helps us understand and organize patterns and symmetries, ideas that are very useful in computer science, especially in fields like cryptography and coding theory.
