# Design Patterns in Software Engineering

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates for solving issues in a reusable, efficient, and understandable way. By using design patterns, developers can create software that is more robust and maintainable.

A simple way to understand design patterns is to think of software in layers: **Data**, **Logic**, and **View**. Each layer has its own role, and design patterns help manage the interaction between these layers.

- **Data Layer**: This layer handles the storage and retrieval of information, often from a database. Patterns like **Repository** or **Data Mapper** ensure efficient data management and separation of concerns.

- **Logic Layer**: This layer contains the core functionality of the application. Patterns like **Singleton**, **Strategy**, or **Command** are often used here to organize business rules and processes.

- **View Layer**: This is the user-facing layer, responsible for presenting information to the user. Patterns like **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** or **Observer** help in managing the interaction between the logic and what the user sees.

By leveraging these patterns, developers can build software that is modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. Design patterns simplify complex software engineering challenges and provide a common language for teams to communicate solutions.
