# Algorithms are just recipes

Algorithm - the buzzword many people use but do not know its meaning. There is an easy way to understand this big word.

When working with algorithms, we have an input, follow some steps, and return an output. Those steps can be iteratively one by one or loops in which a process is repeated multiple times. The same procedure as when following a recipe.

Take the example of making the dough for cookies. As input, we take flour, butter, sugar, and an egg. For the steps, we need to knead the flour, butter, sugar, and egg until the mass becomes a smooth dough (while loop). Now, we have the finished dough ready to be processed (output).

This does not mean that algorithms and functions are the same thing. An algorithm can be implemented using functions but is not limited to it or programming in general.
