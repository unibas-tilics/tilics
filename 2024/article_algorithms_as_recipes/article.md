# Algorithms are just recipes

Algorithm - the buzzword many people use but do not know about its meaning. There is an easy way to understand this big word.

In one of my first lectures during my bachelor's, a professor used 'recipe' as a metaphor for an algorithm. When working with algorithms, we have an input, follow some steps, and return an output. Those steps can be iteratively one by one or loops where we repeat a certain process multiple times.

Taken the example of making the dough for cookies. As input we take flour, butter, sugar and an egg. For the steps we need to knead the flour, butter, sugar, and the egg until the mass becomes a smooth dough (while loop). Now we have the finished dough ready to be processed (output).
