# Algorithms are just recipes

Algorithm - this buzzword many people use but do not know about its meaning. There is an easy way to understand this big word.

In one of my first lectures during my bachelor's, a professor used 'recipe' as a metaphor for an algorithm. When working with algorithms, we have an input, follow some steps (for example, calculations), and return an output.

Sad inputs are the ingredients that we process according to defined steps. And in the end, we have a finished meal.
