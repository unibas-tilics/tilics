# "Managing Multitasking: Processes and Threads"
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Processes and threads are essential to how operating systems run programs. 

Imagine each process as its own building, where each building is dedicated to a specific program or task. Within each building, there are different departments - these represent “threads”. The departments within each building, handle the subtasks of the same program at the same time, allowing tasks to be completed faster and more efficiently.

For example, when you open a web browser, your computer creates a new process, like a seperate building, which runs independently from other programs and doesn’t interfere with them. Inside this browser “building”, the departments (threads) handle individual tasks like loading pages, diplaying images or even processing JavaScript.

Thanks to processes and threads, computers can divide tasks efficiently, enabling them to handle many tasks at once.
