# "Managing Multitasking: Processes and Threads"
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
To understand how computers handle multiple tasks simultaneously, it's important to know about processes and threads.

A process can be thought of as a self-contained project with its own resources and tasks, that runs independently from other processes. Within each process there are smaller units called threads that take on specific roles to accomplish the overall task. 

For example, imagine an ant colony focused on gathering food: the colony represents a process, while groups of ants (threads) divide the work. Some ants locate food, others transport it, and some protect the nest. 

This teamwork mirrors how threads in a process collaborate, breaking down tasks for greater efficiency.
