# What would you choose?

Want to play a game? You will play against an opponent, and you both have to make a choice in each round: **Cooperate** or **Refuse**?
Here's how it works: If both of you refuse, you each get 1\$. If both cooperate, you score 3\$ each. 
But if you cooperate and your opponent refuses, they get 5\$ while you get nothing. Crucially, you don't know what your opponent will choose. So, what's the smartest move? 

Say your opponent will refuse, then you should also refuse to avoid complete loss. 
And in case your opponent will cooperate, you should also refuse to snag 3$. 
Seems like refusing is the best choice, right? But guess what? Your opponent likely thinks the same way, and you both end up with just 1$ each. 

This game is a classic thought experiment in Game Theory called the Prisoner's Dilemma. In the 1980s, Professor Axelrod determined the winning strategy: Start by cooperating, and then mimic your opponent's last move! So even if locally refusing is the best option. In the overall scope of the game, cooperating is better for you and your opponent!
