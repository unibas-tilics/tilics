# What would you choose?

You are offered to play a game against another person. In each round, you have two choices: **Cooperate** or **Refuse**. 
If both players refuse, each player gets $1$ coin. If both cooperate, each player gets $3$ coins. 
But, if you cooperate and your opponent refuses, they get $5$ coins, and you get nothing. So what should you do?

If your opponent refuses, you should also refuse; otherwise, you will get nothing. 
If your opponent cooperates, you should again refuse, to get $3$ coins. 
So you might conclude that refusing is your best option.
However, your opponent will likely reach the same conclusion, and you both will only receive $1$ coin per round.

This game is a reformulation of a problem known in Game Theory as the Prisoner's Dilemma. 
In the 1980s, Professor Axelrod ran a tournament where different computer programs played this game against each other in several rounds.
The program that came out on top would always copy the opponent's move, it would start by cooperating and only refuse if the opponent refused in the last round.
