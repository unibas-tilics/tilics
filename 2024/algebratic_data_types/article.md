# Algebraic Data Types

If you ever find yourself lacking words to describe the beauty of nature, a computer scientist can help you with that.

The language is called **algebraic data types** (ADTs). In this language, $+$ means "the thing is either this or that," while $*$ signifies "the thing consists of these parts."

And so we might write  
$$Tree = Leaf + Branch (Tree * Tree)$$  
which translates to "a tree could be as small as just a leaf, or as large as one that can be seen as branches into two other trees."

When overwhelmed by huge codebases, computer scientists break them down into simple parts to better understand them. Once described as data types, objects are well understood by the computer and can be managed more safely or automatically optimized. ADTs is baked into programming languages like TypeScript, Rust, and Haskell as a fundamental concept.
