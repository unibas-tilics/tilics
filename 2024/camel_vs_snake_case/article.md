# CamelCase vs. snake_case, why coding conventions matter

Ever used a light yellow marker on a whiteboard? Ever worked in an intercultural team where everyone was speaking in their mother tongue? Readability and collaboration are â€¦ hard.

The equivalent happens when programmers do not stick to naming conventions when coding. Coding conventions matter because they improve readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other programmers.

Naming conventions vary based on the programming language and coding style of the programmer. Good examples are the naming conventions often used for Python with snake_case for variables and functions, and CamelCase for classes. It is not forbidden to use another style, but using_this_style or thisStyle improves readability incontrasttothis.
