# CamelCase vs. snake case, why coding conventions matter

Have you ever used a light yellow marker on a whiteboard? Have you ever worked in an international team where everyone was speaking in their mother tongue? Readability and collaboration are hard.

The equivalent happens when programmers do not stick to naming conventions when coding. Coding conventions matter because they improve readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other programmers.

Naming conventions vary based on the programming language and the programmer's coding style. Good examples are the naming conventions often used for Python - snake_case for variables and functions and CamelCase for classes. It is not forbidden to use another style, but using_this_style or ThisStyle improves readability incontrasttothis.
