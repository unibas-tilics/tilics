# CamelCase vs. snake_case, why coding conventions matter

Coding conventions are like grammar rules in natural languages. Just as you should use punctuation marks, using the correct coding conventions improves readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other programmers. 

Good examples are the naming conventions for Python, to use snake_case for variables and functions, and CamelCase for classes. It is not forbidden to use another style, but using_this_style or thisStyle improves readability in incontrasttothis.
