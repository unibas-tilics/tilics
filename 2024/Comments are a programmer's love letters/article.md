# Comments are a programmer's love letters
 In the secret language of code, programmers leave little notes called comments. These aren’t for the computers—they couldn’t care less—but for other humans who might peek at the code later, including the programmer themselves who may have forgotten everything overnight. Comments are like scribbles in a textbook, adding hints to make tricky concepts easier to understand. 

For example, a programmer might write:

``` python
# This is a single-line comment in Python
print("Hello, world!") 
```

Without comments, code can be a confusing maze. Sure, it works, but why? Comments give clues, like a hidden diary entry: “Here’s why I did this,” or “Don’t touch this—it’s holding everything together!” They’re the programmer’s way of saying, “I was here, and I wanted you to understand.” 

So next time you see a comment, think of it as a love letter—left with care, a dash of humor, and a desire to make things a little clearer, just for you.
