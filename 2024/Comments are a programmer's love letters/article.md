# Comments are a programmer's love letters
In the language of code, programmers leave little notes called comments—not for computers, but for humans who might read the code later.  Comments are like textbook scribbles, offering hints to clarify tricky concepts. 

Without comments, code may be a confusing maze. Sure, it works, but why? Comments give clues, like a hidden diary entry: “Here’s why I did this,” or “Don’t touch this—it’s holding everything together!” Still, balance is important: excessive commenting can clutter the code and reduce its readability, so add comments only where necessary. 

So next time you see a comment, think of it as a love letter—left with care, thought, and clarity, just for you.
