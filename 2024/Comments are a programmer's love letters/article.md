# Comments are a programmer's love letters
In the language of code, programmers leave little notes called comments—not for computers, but for humans who might read the code later.  Comments are like textbook scribbles, offering hints to clarify tricky concepts. 

Without comments, code may be a confusing maze. Sure, it works, but why? Comments give clues: “Here’s why I did this,” or “Don’t touch this—it’s holding everything together!” Still,  balance is crucial: too few comments make code hard to understand, while too many can make it cluttered. 

When you see a comment, think of it as a love letter—left with care, thought, and clarity, just for you.
