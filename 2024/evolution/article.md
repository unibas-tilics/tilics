# Darwin theory in Computer Science

Evolutionary algorithms are a type of computer algorithm inspired by the process of natural evolution. They are designed to solve problems by mimicking how living organisms evolve over generations. These algorithms work by creating a population of potential solutions, evaluating their quality, and refining them through the processes of **selection**, **crossover** and  **mutation**. Over time, this "survival of the fittest" approach leads to increasingly effective solutions.
