# Making Decisions: Conditional Statements"
<!-- END TITLE -->

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on specific conditions, helping computers adapt to different scenarios.

In programming, conditional statements typically use keywords like **if**, **else**, and **elif** (else if). For instance, an **if** statement checks whether a condition is true, and if so, it executes a certain block of code. An **else** provides an alternative path if the condition is false, while **elif** offers additional checks.

For example, consider the decisions we make based on the weather:
- **If** it's raining, take an umbrella.
- **Else If** it's sunny, wear sunglasses.
- **Else**, just head out as usual.

These statements are essential for controlling how a program runs. Without them, programs would be rigid and unable to respond to changing situations effectively.
