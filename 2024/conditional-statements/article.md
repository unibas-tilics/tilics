# Making Decisions: Conditional Statements

Programming without conditional statements is like going through life with no plan B. They are the ultimate computer decision-makers since they allow them to adapt to different scenarios.

These statements use **if**, **else**, and **elif** (**else if**) to guide programs:
- **"If"** checks whether a condition is true or false and runs a certain block of code - **If** it's raining, take an umbrella. 
- **"Elif"** offers additional checks - **Else, If** it's sunny, wear sunglasses.
- **"Else"** provides an alternative path - **Else**, just head out as usual.

These statements are essential for controlling how a program runs. Without them, programs would be as flexible as a broken ruler and unable to effectively adapt to changing circumstances.
