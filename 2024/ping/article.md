# Knock Knock Google / Google, are you there?
    
Ping - is one of the simplest command-line utilities, which tests if one computer can reach another on the internet or within a network. It sends small data packets to the target IP address and measures how long it takes for a response. If the target replies, it confirms the connection and shows the time taken, helping to check if the connection is working and how fast and reliable it is. 
Ping is pre-installed on most popular operating systems, such as macOS and Windows, so you can try it out by opening a command line on your computer and typing "ping" followed by a website address.
Since Google is the most popular and visited website in the world, we oftenly use simply `ping google.com` to understand, whether the computer can properly reach internet websites.
