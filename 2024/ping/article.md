# Google, are you there?
    
Ping is one of the simplest utilities used in a computer's Terminal. It allows you to check if your computer can reach another on the Internet or within a network. It sends small pieces of data to the target computer and measures how long it takes for a response. If the target replies, it confirms the connection and shows the time taken, helping to check if the connection is working and how fast and reliable it is. 

Ping is pre-installed on most computers running macOS or Windows, so you can try it out by opening a command line on your computer and typing "ping" followed by a website address.

Since Google.com is the most popular and visited website in the world, we often use ping google.com to understand whether our computer can properly reach Internet websites.
