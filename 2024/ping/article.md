# Google, are you there?
    
Ping is one of the simplest utilities used in a computer's Terminal. By using it, you can check if your computer can reach another on the Internet or within a network. It sends small pieces of data to the target computer and measures how long it takes for a response. If the target replies, it confirms the connection and shows the time taken, helping to check if the connection is working and how fast and reliable it is.Â 

Since Google.com is the most popular and visited website in the world, we often use simply `ping google.com` to understand whether our computer can properly reach Internet websites.
