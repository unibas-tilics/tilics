# Gaining from Unsolvable Problems


In our everyday lives, we encounter various challenges. Some can be solved by computers in a reasonable amount of time, like sorting our emails or finding the fastest route on a map, while others, such as predicting complex weather patterns or solving certain mathematical problems, cannot be computed efficiently.

At first glance, it might seem disappointing that not everything can be computed. However, this limitation also presents an opportunity. Since no algorithm can efficiently solve these hard problems, we can design algorithms that use these unsolvable problems as part of their computation. Because no one can solve this step, it becomes very difficult for anyone to break the algorithm, leading to a strong foundation for security.

Next time you face a tough, unsolvable problem, you might just smileâ€”after all, it could lead to your next big security breakthrough!
