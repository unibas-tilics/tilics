# Peer-to-Peer: A Better Way to Work Together

You and your friends love reading books but rely on a library to borrow them. If the library is closed, you can’t get the books you need. To solve this, you and your friends start sharing books directly—if one of you has a book another wants, you lend it; if you need a book, you ask around until someone shares it.

This is how peer-to-peer (P2P) networking works: instead of depending on a central server, devices connect directly to share or request information. P2P is faster and more reliable since no one depends on a single system. It's widely used for securely exchanging money and sharing resources, proving that working together directly is both efficient and effective.
