# Peer-to-Peer: A Better Way to Work Together

You and your friends love reading books but rely on a library to borrow them. If the library is closed, you canâ€™t get the needed books. To solve this, you and your friends start sharing books directly - if one of you has a book another wants, you lend it; if you need a book, you ask around until someone shares it.

That is how peer-to-peer (P2P) networking works: instead of depending on a central server, devices connect directly to share or request information. P2P is faster and more reliable since no one depends on a single system. It gets used for securely exchanging money and sharing resources. Of course, without a central authority, P2P can also carry risks if malicious peers share harmful files, but it still proves that directly working together is both efficient and effective.
