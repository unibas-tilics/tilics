# HTTP vs HTTPS

While surfing the internet, you have certainly noticed the abbreviations HTTP and HTTPS at the beginning of websites. But do you know the difference between the two? First of all, HTTP is an abbreviation of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This protocol allows communication between our browser and the web server, but the messages sent in this communication are not encrypted. If we share sensitive information, such as name, address, credit card number information, with the website, we may experience security problems. Nowadays, most websites use HTTPS to avoid such situations. The "S" in the abbreviation stands for security, and this protocol encrypts the transferred messages using SSL and TLS protocols. This way we can move around the internet more securely.
