# HTTP vs HTTPS

While surfing the internet, you have certainly noticed the abbreviations HTTP and HTTPS at the beginning of websites. But do you know the difference between the two?

HTTP, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is used to transfer information between your browser and a web server. However, this communication is not secure, as the messages sent are not encrypted. This means that sensitive information, such as your name, address, or credit card details, could be accessed by attackers and used for harmful purposes.

To address this problem, most websites now use HTTPS. The "S" stands for Secure, which means the information exchanged is encrypted. This ensures that even if someone tries to access the data, they wonâ€™t be able to understand it. HTTPS provides an additional layer of security, allowing us to browse the internet with greater safety and confidence.
