What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is like superhero team. Each hero (object) has their own powers (data/attributes) and tricks(methods) specified in Class called superhero team. These objects store values. Heroes keep their true identities hidden, which in OOP is known as Encapsulation. With Abstraction you do not need to understand how heroes fly, just that they do. Through Inheritance, sidekicks can copy powers from their mentors. In the end, they save the day while you chill and take the credit. ðŸ˜Š
