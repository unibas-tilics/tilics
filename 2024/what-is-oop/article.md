# What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is just one of many flavors of programming, offering a structured way to build software. It is like building a superhero team (a group of objects) based on a blueprint (class).

For example, if "Superhero" is the class, "Wonder Woman" and "Superman" are individual objects (instances) of that class. These objects store values.

Each hero (object) has their own powers (data/attributes) and tricks (methods), but they all follow the same blueprint (class).

Heroes keep their true identities hidden, which in OOP is known as Encapsulation. Objects provide a layer of Abstraction, so that the user does not need to know the internals of the code. Much like heroes, you do not need to know how they fly, but you know that they do.

Reusability is a key feature of OOP; you can reuse classes and objects across different parts of a program or even in other projects, just like calling on the same hero for different missions.

In the end, they save the day while you chill, unaware of the chaos they have handled.
