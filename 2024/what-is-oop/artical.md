# What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP ) is like building a superhero team. Each hero (object) has their own powers (data/attributes) and tricks (methods). All objects together form a class, the superhero team. These objects store values. Heroes keep their true identities hidden, which in OOP is known as Encapsulation. Objects provide a layer of Abstraction, so that the user does not need to know the internals of the code. Just like with heroes, you do not need to know how they fly, but you know that they do. Through Inheritance, sidekicks can copy powers from their mentors. In the end, they save the day while you chill, unaware of the chaos they have handled.
