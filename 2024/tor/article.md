# Tor

Tor (The Onion Router) is a network designed for anonymous internet browsing. Originally developed for secure communications, it now allows users to hide their identity by routing their traffic through multiple servers (nodes). Each layer of routing is encrypted, making it difficult to trace the original source.

Tor is widely used for bypassing censorship, accessing the dark web, or protecting privacy. However, its speed is slower due to the multiple layers of encryption, and its security depends on proper use. While Tor provides anonymity, itâ€™s not foolproof and works best when combined with other privacy tools.
