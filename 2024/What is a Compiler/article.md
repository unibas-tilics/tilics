# What is a Compiler? 

Imagine you are at a restaurant in a foreign country. You order spaghetti, but the waiter doesn’t understand your language. Luckily, a translator steps in, turning your request into something the waiter understands, and makes sure you get exactly what you want. That’s what a compiler does for computers.

A compiler takes the code you write in a language like Python or Java and translates it into instructions your computer can follow. Without it, your computer would stare blankly at your program, much like that waiter without a translator. It also checks your code for errors, so you don’t accidentally ask your computer to do the impossible. In the end, it  produces a version your computer can actually use.
