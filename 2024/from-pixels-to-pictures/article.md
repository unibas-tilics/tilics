# From pixels to pictures

If you look closely at a computer screen, you'll see it's made up of millions of tiny squares called pixels, short for picture elements. Each pixel's color is represented by three numbers, ranging from 0 to 255, for the intensities of red, green, and blue. Different combinations of these numbers can create over 16 million colors. With these tiny squares filled with colors, we can generate all kind of possible images you can imagine! This is similar to how different combinations of a limited number of atoms can create a vast array of objects.
