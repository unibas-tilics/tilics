# From pixels to pictures

If you look closely at a computer screen, you'll see it's made up of millions of tiny squares called pixels, short for picture elements. To color these pixels, the most common approach uses three numbers, ranging from 0 to 255, for the intensities of red, green, and blue or RGB in short. Different combinations of these numbers can create over 16 million colors. 

With these tiny squares filled with colors, we can generate all kind of possible images you can imagine! For better quality, use smaller squares; in other words, the more pixels, the higher the quality.
