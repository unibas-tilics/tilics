# Frontend vs Backend

When building software, especially web applications, we often hear about the frontend and backend. These two parts work together to make an app function, but they handle different tasks.

The frontend is everything users see and interact with - the buttons, images, text, colors, and layout. Think of it as the “face” of the app. But what we see on the frontend is just the surface.

The backend is what runs behind the scenes, handling everything users don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, managing security, and processing complex tasks. You can think of it as the app’s “brain”, keeping everything in sync and functioning smoothly.
