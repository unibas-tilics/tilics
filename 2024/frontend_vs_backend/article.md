# Frontend vs Backend

Building software, especially web applications, starts with understanding the roles of frontend and backend. These two parts work together to make an app function, but they handle different tasks.

The frontend is everything users see and interact with - the buttons, images, text, colors, and layout. Think of it as the face of the app.

The backend operates behind the scenes. It is like the internal organs, managing data, security, and processes that keep everything running smoothly.
