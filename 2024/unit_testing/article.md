# Understanding Unit Testing

*Unit testing* is a fundamental part of software development. It involves testing small, individual pieces of code, known as "units," to make sure each one works correctly on its own. Imagine building a machine – before putting all the parts together, you’d want to test each component separately to ensure it functions as expected. That’s what unit testing is for in coding.

By testing each unit separately, developers can catch errors early, before they become bigger issues in the entire application. Unit tests are automated, meaning that developers write test scripts that automatically check if each unit of code behaves as expected. This process saves time and reduces the risk of bugs in the final product.

When each small unit of code works as intended, developers can confidently combine them into larger parts of the application. Unit testing serves as a strong foundation, ensuring that each piece is reliable before moving on to the next phase of development.

In short, unit testing helps create reliable, high-quality software by focusing on testing the smallest components individually.
