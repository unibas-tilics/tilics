## Staying safe with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) means your accounts require more than just a password to log in. After entering your password, 2FA asks for a second factor, such as a code sent to your phone or a biometric scan. This prevents unauthorized access, even if someone manages to steal your password.

2FA provides an extra layer of protection without adding too much hassle. Itâ€™s one of the easiest ways to stay safe from hackers and keep your sensitive information secure.
