# NLP: Teaching Computers to Understand Human Language

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is how computers learn to understand and use human language. By mimicking how humans learn — through studying examples and recognizing patterns — NLP breaks language into pieces and identifies meaning and context.

For instance, when you say "It’s raining cats and dogs", NLP knows it means heavy rain, not animals falling. It achieves this by analyzing vast amounts of text to grasp grammar, idioms, and common usage.

In short, NLP combines learning and pattern recognition to teach computers the art of human communication.
