# Functions: Your Coding Recipe
    
Imagine you’re baking cookies from scratch and come up with the most delicious recipe. To save yourself from figuring it out again next time, you write down the recipe, give it a name, list the ingredients, and include step-by-step instructions. Now, whenever you want cookies, you simply follow the recipe.

In programming, a function works just like that. It’s a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions take input (like ingredients), process it according to the instructions, and produce output (like cookies). Instead of repeating code, you call the function, and it handles the rest, making your program easier to read and maintain.
