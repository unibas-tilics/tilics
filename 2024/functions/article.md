# Building a LEGO House: One Function at a Time
    
Creating a LEGO house is more than just stacking bricks; it’s all about following clever instructions. The **House Function**, like the instruction manual in a LEGO set, doesn’t start from scratch. Instead, it relies on outputs from smaller functions:

- The **Wall Function** takes bricks (inputs) and builds a wall (output).
- The **Door Function** turns panels and hinges into a door.
- The **Window Function** transforms clear pieces into windows.

These outputs become inputs for the **House Function**, which assembles them into the ultimate LEGO dream house. The beauty? The same function works with different inputs. Swap house walls for castle towers and the **House Function** builds a castle instead. 

This is how functions work in programming; breaking big tasks into smaller, reusable steps for efficiency and clarity.
