# Obfuscation - Unreadable by Design

Obfuscation involves scrambling your code to make it difficult for people to understand while still allowing it to work as intended.

This is especially helpful for mobile apps or websites that contain sensitive information, like proprietary algorithms or business logic, that you want to protect from being stolen or misused.

There are many ways to obfuscate code, but some common techniques include:
- Using confusing variable names (e.g., `xcf00` instead of `purchaseRecord`).  
- Obscuring code flows using control flow tricks.
- Adding extra, unnecessary code to throw off anyone trying to analyze it.  

Although obfuscation makes it harder to reverse-engineer a program, it’s not perfect. A concept called black-box obfuscation—where a program’s outputs can’t reveal how they were calculated—has been proven impossible. This means while obfuscation does provide some protection, it is **not absolute**.
