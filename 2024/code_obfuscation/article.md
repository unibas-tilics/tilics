# Obfuscation - Unreadable by Design

Obfuscation involves scrambling your code to make it nearly unreadable to humans, while maintaining its functionality. 

This is particularly useful when sharing code in mobile apps or websites that may contain intellectual property (e.g., proprietary algorithms or business logic) you want to protect from exploitation by malicious actors.

There are thousands of obfuscation techniques, but common ones include using hard-to-read variable names (e.g., `xcf00` instead of `purchaseRecord`), employing control flow tricks, or adding redundant artifacts to confuse anyone attempting to analyze the code.

While obfuscation can make reverse engineering more difficult, **black-box obfuscation** has been proven to be impossible. This means obfuscation does provide some protection - but **not absolute**.
