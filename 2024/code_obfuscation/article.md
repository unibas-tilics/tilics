# Obfuscation - Unreadable by Design  

Obfuscation involves scrambling code to make it difficult for people to understand while still allowing it to work as intended.
This is especially helpful for mobile apps or websites that contain sensitive information, such as proprietary algorithms or business logic, that you want to protect from being stolen or misused.
Some common techniques include:

- Using confusing variable names (e.g., xcf00 instead of purchaseRecord).
- Reorganizing the program's structure to make its logic harder to follow.
- Adding extra, unnecessary code to throw off anyone trying to analyze it.

While obfuscation offers some protection to make reverse engineering practically more challenging, it can't completely prevent it. A theoretical concept called black-box obfuscation has been proven impossible, meaning obfuscated code always leaks some of the intentionally hidden information.
