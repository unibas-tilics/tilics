# Obfuscation - Spaghetti Code Ready to Serve

You want to share your mobile app or website with the world, but your code (e.g., Java or JavaScript) may contain intellectual properties that you don't want malicious actors to understand yet. To share or not to share: code obfuscation can help with this problem.

Obfuscation involves scrambling your code into a spaghetti hot mess to make it nearly impossible to read while preserving the logic. There are thousands of techniques, but common ones include using hard-to-read variable names (e.g., `xcf00` instead of `purchaseRecord`), control flow tricks, or adding redundant artifacts to mislead code readers.

Obfuscation offers some protection (but not absolute!) by preventing others from understanding your code. As useful as it can be, it can also be used to hide malicious code. Safety-critical platforms, such as the Chrome browser, would outright ban any extension that uses obfuscated code.
