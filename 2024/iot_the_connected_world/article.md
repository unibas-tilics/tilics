# Internet of Things – The Connected World

The Internet of Things (IoT) is about everyday devices connected to the internet and to each other, transforming ordinary objects into a smart, connected network that enhances convenience of our lives. Imagine your fridge sending a shopping list to your phone, or your house thermostat adjusting the temperature based on your preferences.

This is made possible by embedded sensors, wireless communication protocols like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and cloud computing platforms that process and store data.

It’s like all your gadgets are chatting and working together to make your life easier :)
