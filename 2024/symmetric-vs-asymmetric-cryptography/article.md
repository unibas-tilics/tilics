# Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography

In todayâ€™s digital world, securing information is essential. We use cryptography to convert data into unreadable code. There are two main types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric Cryptography is simpler and uses the same key for both encrypting (scrambling) and decrypting (unscrambling) information. This requires both parties to agree on a secret key in advance and keep it confidential, which can be challenging.

Asymmetric cryptography, on the other hand, uses a pair of mathematically related keys. One key, called the private key, is used to encrypt a message, while the other, known as the public key, is used for decryption.

In practice, both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are used together, depending on the application.
