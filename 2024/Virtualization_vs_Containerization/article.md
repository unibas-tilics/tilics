# Virtualization vs Containerization

The challenge for modern computers is to use hardware resources efficiently. This problem is addressed by virtualization and containerization, which offer strategies for effectively utilizing the hardware resources of a real computer.

The key differences between virtualization and containerization are usage of hardware and resource overhead.

Virtualization builds operating system-based virtual machines (VMs) on top of actual hardware. While, Containerization makes physical hardware more efficient and lightweight by generating containers that run the same operating system (OS). Each virtual machine needs its operating system so virtual machines use more resources and since containers use the same operating system, they are lightweight and improve resource usage and startup times.
