#When One Bug Brings Its Entire Family

Finding a bug in your code? Oh, that’s just the tip of the iceberg, my friend. It’s like finding one ant in your kitchen—you know the rest of the colony is throwing a party behind the fridge. Fixing that first bug is just their way of saying, “Welcome to the family, we’ve been expecting you!” And just when you think you’ve won, another sneaky cousin pops up to ruin your day. Debugging isn’t solving problems; it’s herding wild bugs and hoping for the best. Good luck—you’re gonna need it!
