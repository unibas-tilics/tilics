# The Million Dollar Question 

Ever wondered how quickly problems can be solved? Or if some problems can’t be cracked efficiently at all? Enter the fascinating world of computer science, where problems are grouped into the categories P and NP! 

P stands for *polynomial time*. This section of problems is easy to tackle, and we know how to find solutions efficiently. Now, NP is where things get harder! It stands for *nondeterministic polynomial time*.
This means that if you could magically try out all possible solutions at once (this is non-determinism), you would quickly find a solution (in polynomial time). 
Put differently, if you can quickly verify that something is indeed a solution to a problem, then that problem is in NP. 

Here’s the catch: no physical computer can pull this non-determinism off, which means that problems in NP currently cannot be solved efficiently. 
Interestingly, we still don’t know if finding faster solutions for NP problems is possible. There is a million-dollar prize for the person who can determine if P equals NP, implying that solving a problem is as hard as verifying a potential solution!
