# Search and Sort Algorithms

Often, kids have a big pile of toys in their playroom. There are teddy bears, blocks, and toy cars everywhere. The kid might want to search for a specific toy. Maybe they dig through all their toys, one by one, until they find it. On the contrary, if the toys are sorted, they can find the wanted one quickly!
Sorting means creating a neat order, like arranging the blocks by size, from the smallest to the biggest or the opposite. If you have cars, you can line them up by color or size. Imagine how easy it now is for them to search for a specific item after sorting them first.
