# Search and Sort Algorithms

Often kids have a big pile of toys in their playroom. There are teddy bears, blocks and toy cars everywhere. The kid might want to search for a specific toy. Maybe they dig through all their toys, one by one, until they find it. Or if their toys are already sorted, they can find it super quickly!
Sorting means putting them in a neat order, like arranging the blocks by size, from the smallest to the biggest or the opposite. Or if you have cars, you can line them up by color or size. Imagine how easy it is now for them to search for a specific item after sorting them first.
