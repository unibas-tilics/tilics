# Time and Space Complexity: The Soul of Algorithms
    
In computer science, time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of its input, while space complexity tracks how much memory it uses. Both are critical when evaluating an algorithmâ€™s efficiency.

For example, consider sorting a list of names. If the list is short, most algorithms perform quickly. But as the list grows, the differences between algorithms become noticeable. Some might handle a million names efficiently, while others could take hours. Similarly, an algorithm that requires storing every possible combination of input might work for small data sizes but become infeasible as the input grows.

The size of the problem fundamentally shapes how we design algorithms. Understanding time and space complexity helps us identify such challenges and create solutions that scale effectively.
