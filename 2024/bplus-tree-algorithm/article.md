# The infamous B+Tree Data Structure
Think of B+ Tree as a library where the front desk handles directions, the aisles handle the books, and everything is connected in a way that even the messiest visitor (you, the one who shows up with no clue about where to find anything but expects instant results) can find what they need efficiently.

This Data Structure is used by MySQL under the hood for indexing.
