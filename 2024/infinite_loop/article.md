# When Code Never Stops

An infinite loop in programming repeats endlessly until externally interrupted. It can be intentional, like in constant monitoring systems, or unintentional due to errors. Intentional loops use constructs like while (true), while unintentional loops often result from logical or mathematical mistakes. These loops can make systems unresponsive but can usually be interrupted by signals or commands. Determining if a program contains an infinite loop is generally undecidable, known as the halting problem.
