    # Ethical Hacking vs. Malicious Hacking
    
    Hacking means accessing a computer system, but the intention behind it determines whether itâ€™s ethical or malicious.
    
    Imagine calling a locksmith to check your door locks and suggest improvements. This reflects the role of an ethical hacker, who identifies vulnerabilities to strengthen security. In contrast, a thief breaking in to steal valuables resembles a malicious hacker, exploiting weaknesses for harmful purposes.
    
    Ethical hackers help organizations protect their systems by fixing security flaws before they are exploited. Malicious hackers, on the other hand, aim to steal data, disrupt services, or cause harm. While their techniques may overlap, their intentions make all the difference. Ethical hacking is a crucial part of maintaining digital safety in a world shaped by digital connections.
