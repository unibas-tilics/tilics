# Ethical Hacking vs. Malicious Hacking

Hacking means accessing a computer system or its data without authorization. What makes it ethical or malicious is the intention behind it.

Imagine a locksmith inspecting your locks to improve security. This reflects the role of an ethical hacker, who helps organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities to prevent them from being taken advantage of.

In contrast, a burglar breaking into your home to steal valuables resembles a malicious hacker, who exploits weaknesses to cause harm. While both may use similar techniques, their intentions and the impact of their actions are what set them apart.
