 # **Speed** or **Freshness**?
    
    
Let’s say you’re managing a cafeteria. You have trays stacked up, and customers keep arriving. Now, ask yourself which makes more sense, taking trays from the bottom or the top?

If you take trays from the **top (FILO - First In Last Out)**, the most recently added trays get used first. It’s faster and more efficient since you don’t have to shuffle around, but the trays at the bottom could sit there untouched, possibly collecting dust or even going unused for too long.

On the other hand, if you take trays from the **bottom (FIFO - First In First Out)**, the older trays are used first. This ensures that none stay at the bottom for too long, avoiding dust. Just like how grocery stores push older products forward to ensure they’re sold first, keeping things fresh.

So, would you rather prioritize? It depends on what’s more important at your cafeteria.
