# Loops

In programming, subtasks often have to be repeated multiple times for a piece of software to accomplish a certain goal.

Loops efficiently repeat actions without duplicating code. 
We then define a statement called a "condition" that can be either **true** or **false**, leading to repeated execution of the code within the loop until this statement becomes false.
Two common types are **for** and **while** loops.

- A for-loop is ideal for tasks where the number of iterations is known beforehand, such as processing every item in a collection or calculating an average over a fixed dataset.
- A while-loop works best when the number of repetitions depends on a condition, like repeatedly performing calculations until a result meets a specific criterion.

Loops are more than a convenience—they’re essential for solving problems that inherently require repetition. Whether iterating through data or refining results, loops enable clear, maintainable, and efficient solutions, with exit conditions ensuring they complete as intended.
