# Loops

In programming, subtasks often have to be repeated multiple times for a piece of software to accomplish a certain goal.

Loops efficiently repeat actions without duplicating code.
Programmers can define a statement called a "condition" that can be either true or false, leading to repeated execution of the code within the loop until this statement becomes false. This is how a while loop works. In a for loop on the other hand the programmer can specify exactly how many repetitions they want, for example 10 or 20 or any other number. These two loops are the most common types.

Loops are a fundamental tool for solving repetitive tasks in programming, making our solutions both efficient and elegant while conditions ensure that loops are exited as intended.
