#Loops

Often in computer science some task is performed multiple times. Writing the same piece of code repeatedly, is not only tedious but also results in a cluttered programm that is harder to read and to maintain.

This problem is elegantly solved using loops. Loops, such as ```for``` and ```while```, allow us to repeat actions efficiently without duplicating code. A for-loop is ideal when you need to run code **for** a certain amount of iterations, whereas a while-loop is perfect for cases where you continue **while* a certain condition is met.

Using loops not only saves time and effort but also leads to cleaner, more maintainable code. They are a fundamental tool for solving repetitive tasks in programming, making our solutions both efficient and elegant.
