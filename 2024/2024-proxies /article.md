# I Know a Guy Who Knows Someone: How Proxies Work

So imagine you have a friend named Bob, and he knows someone named Alice, but you can’t talk to Alice directly. Instead, you send a message to Bob, and he forwards it to Alice. When Alice replies, she sends her message to Bob, and he passes it back to you. This is how a proxy works! Proxies act as intermediaries, forwarding your requests and responses while hiding your real identity and location.

By using a proxy like Bob, the website you’re visiting only sees Bob, not you. Proxies can also help you access geo-restricted content or speed up browsing because Bob might already have a cached copy of the site. However, proxies don’t encrypt your data, so they don’t provide complete privacy.
