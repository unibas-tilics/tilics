# Datatype vs Variable

Think of a DataType as the form or nature of the information you are handling, like numbers, text, or lists. On the other hand, a Variable is essentially a named location in memory that holds this information, acting like an address.

In strongly-typed languages, choosing the right DataType matters because mismatched data can cause errors or unexpected behavior. For example, trying to store a decimal value in an integer type would lead to data loss. In typeless languages, variables can store different data types flexibly, but you still need to manage data carefully.

Imagine you want to store soup. A sturdy container, like a bowl, suits it better than a paper bag. In code, similarly, matching the right DataType with the appropriate variable ensures safe and efficient storage.
