# The Battle for Your Data

Your personal data is a goldmine.

Companies use it to sell products, shape opinions, and train AI. It’s why ads feel psychic and why scandals like Facebook sharing data with Cambridge Analytica—impacting the 2016 U.S. election—shook the world.

But it’s not just ads. Careless sharing risks exposing your identity, location, or finances, putting you and your loved ones at risk.

The good news? Governments are catching up. Regulations like the GDPR empower individuals by forcing companies to disclose data collection practices and seek explicit consent.

Meanwhile, privacy innovations like Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Differential Privacy, and end-to-end encryption (E2EE) are emerging. Apps like Signal or WhatsApp, using E2EE, ensure your conversations stay truly private from prying eyes—whether it's hackers, advertisers, or even the service providers themselves.
