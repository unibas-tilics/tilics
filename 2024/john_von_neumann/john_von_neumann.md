# The Architecture of a Computer (John von Neumann)

![test](von_neumann.png)

A computer is like a little workshop with four main parts:

1. **Memory**: This is like a big bookshelf where it keeps instructions (like recipes) and things to work on (like ingredients).

2. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Think of this as the worker who reads the instructions and does the work. It has two tools:
   - **Control Unit**: for understanding what to do.
   - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: the calculator, for doing math and making decisions.

3. **Input/Output**: These are the doors and windows, where information comes in (like typing on a keyboard) and goes out (like showing something on a screen).

4. **Bus System**: The bus is like a conveyor belt that moves stuff between the shelves, the worker, and the doors.

Even though this design was created in 1945, it still works well and is used in almost all computers today!
