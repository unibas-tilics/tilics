    # VPN vs Proxy
    
VPNs and proxies both hide your IP address, but they serve different purposes. VPN encrypts all your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, providing privacy, security, and access to blocked content. It works at the system like a tunnel, wrapping all your internet traffic, making it ideal for secure browsing, streaming, and remote work.

In contrast, a proxy simply routes your traffic through another server, masking your IP for specific apps or browsers. Proxies are faster but donâ€™t encrypt data, making them suitable for lightweight tasks like bypassing regional restrictions but unsuitable for protecting sensitive information.

VPN is better for a constant device security, while proxies could be a quick way for anonymity in limited use cases. For ultimate privacy and encryption, VPNs are the best way to go, but for speed and simplicity proxies can are also quite suitable.
