# Union vs. Intersection of sets of objects - "include, exclude, what?" 

In the context of mathematical foundations in Computer Science, we often work with sets, their union, and intersection respectively. A set is an unordered collection of unique objects (without duplicates). 

Let's look at an example: We have two sets, S1 and S2. Set S1 contains only one object, hair: {hair}, and set S2 contains the objects glasses and hair: {glasses, hair}. We denote a set in these brackets {} and divide the objects with commas.

The union (U) of two sets contains all objects in either set or both. In our example, the union of S1 and S2 (S1 U S2) could be {hair, glasses}, {hair}, or {glasses}.

The intersection (∩) of two sets contains only the objects in both sets. In our example, the intersection of S1 and S2 (S1 ∩ S2) contains the object hair, as both S1 and S2 contain it.
