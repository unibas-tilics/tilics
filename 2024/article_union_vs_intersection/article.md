# Union vs. Intersection of sets of objects - "include, exclude, what?" 

In the context of mathematical foundations in Computer Science, we often work with sets, their union and intersection. A set is an unordered collection of unique objects (without duplicates). Let's look at an example:

Emmie and Timmi are organising a party. Emmie invites her friends Bruno and Thea, while Timmi decides to invite Bruno and Alva. 

Union, the enthusiastic party coordinator, makes sure to invite everyone for the party and merges both guest lists, creating the final lineup: Bruno, Thea, and Alva.

Later, Intersection, the host of the exclusive afterparty, only allows mutual guests. This means that Bruno is the only one invited to the afterparty.
