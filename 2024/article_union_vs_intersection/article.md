# Union vs. Intersection of sets of objects - "include, exclude, what?" 

In the context of sets of objects, we often use the terms union and intersection. For the following explanation, we are looking at an example with two sets containing one object each. Set S1 contains {hair}, and set S2 contains {glasses}.

The union (U) of two sets contains all objects contained in either set or both. In our example, the union of S1 and S2 (S1 U S2) could be {hair, glasses} (or {hair}, or {glasses}).

The intersection of two sets contains only the objects present in both sets. In our example, the intersection of S1 and S2 is empty - no hair and no glasses. If we add another set S3 containing two objects {glasses, beard}, the intersection of S2 and S3 would be {glasses}, as both sets contain {glasses}.
