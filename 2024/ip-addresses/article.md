## IP Addresses

IP addresses are essential for routing data across the internet, serving as a unique identifier for each device. When your device sends a request to a server, it includes both its own IP address and the serverâ€™s. Routers then use this information to direct data packets efficiently, much like a GPS directing traffic. IPv4, the long-standing protocol, has run out of unique addresses due to the exponential growth of connected devices. IPv6 solves this problem by offering a vastly expanded address space, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity as the internet continues to grow.
