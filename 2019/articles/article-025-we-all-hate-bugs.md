Bugs creep into your house without notice, they eat your food and clog your sink. 
They hide in corners, behind large furniture and are most of the times hard to find. When you get rid of a bug that was bothering you for a long time, you feel relieved.
Unlike a real life bug, a software bug causes unintended behavior which can cause minor errors or even crash your system. It is often very hard to find bugs in software and can sometimes be attributed to one single character that was wrongly placed. The act of finding bugs is called debugging. Like pest control, the code is searched and cleaned from every bug that influences the behavior negatively.
Unfortunately, while fixing software bugs, the programmer accidentally adds other bugs. The cycle is endless.
