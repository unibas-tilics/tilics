## TILICS 2024

This is the organisation space for 2024 seminar course.

### Repository Structure

- [Task Force 2024](/admin/taskforces_2024.md)
- Use [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/unibas-tilics/tilics/discussions) for organisational matter.
  - ðŸ’¡ You can tag people to notify them to participate in discussion.

###  For Authors

#### How to create a pull request

##### Step 1 : Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/unibas-tilics/tilics.git
```

##### Step 2 : Create a new branch

Run the following command to create and switch to a new branch: 

```
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

##### Step 3 : Add your article

1. Create a folder in the `2024` directory with the same name as your topic (e.g. `/2024/rices_theorem`).
2. Create a Markdown file (exactly named `article.md`) (e.g. `/2024/rices_theorem/article.md`).
   - ðŸ’¡ Please use the template below. **The format is required for making the document more machine-readable.**

    ```markdown
        # Put your title here as a first-level header (use `#` sign)
        
        Put your article's text in Markdown here.
        Text before the first second-level header (## Authors) will be included in the final PDF.

        ## Authors
        Any text after the first second-level header won't be included in the final PDF. This is useful for adding metadata, such as author information.
        - Alice
        - Bob
    ```

    - Don't link the illustration image in the markdown file. Instead, put your illustration (exactly named `illustration.svg`) to your article directory (e.g. at `/2024/rices_theorem/illustration.svg`).

    - Commit and push to your previously created branch.

##### Step 4 : Open a pull request

Create a pull request from your branch against the `master` branch.  Therefore, please click on `New Pull Request` button and add the description of the pull request.

##### Step 2 : Merge
