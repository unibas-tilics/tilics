\mytopic{Why uptime matters}

The time since a computer was started is referred to as its
\textbf{uptime}. When the computer is rebooted (or crashes), its uptime is
reset to zero. The time the computer is not running is called
\textbf{downtime}.

When running a \textbf{service}, such as a website, we want it to be
available at all times. This means that the \textbf{server} the website is
running on must be available all the time.  As a high uptime means
that a server has been running a long time without interruption, it
can indicate that the provided services are also available with few
interruptions.
