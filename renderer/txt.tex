Instead of doing the same thing over and over again, a good computer scientist tries to automate the task. This not only improves the reliability, but also saves time in the long run. Furthermore, a good computer scientist is also lazy when it comes to writing code. Rather than solving a specific problem, a good programmer develops a generic solution that can be reused for similar problems.

Good programmers are diligent in order to be lazy. Or with other words: They are strategically lazy. And that's a good thing.
