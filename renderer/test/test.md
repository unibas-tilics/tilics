> **Sometimes**, you're just **stuck** on a problem that seems impossible to solve. But then as soon as you start explaining the issue to a friend, the solution suddenly becomes clear.



This is the essence of ***rubber duck debugging***. In this technique, a programmer keeps an inanimate object—often a rubber duck—accompanying them at their desk. By explaining the problem aloud to the duck, they are forced to slow down and think through the issue in more detail. 

On many occasions, this procedure helps in finding the root cause. The duck itself **isn't magical**, but it offers a convenient alternative to always needing someone to talk to whenever you encounter a bug.


1. **Get your rubber duck.**

2. **Explain the problem.**  
   - Speak *loudly* and clearly.  
   - Use **simple terms**.

3. **Identify the solution.**  
   - You may need to:
     - Rethink your approach.
     - Analyze your code step-by-step.


```javascript
console.log(12);
```


Here is some math:  
$x = 12$

And here's a famous equation:  
$$ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. $$

|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | Get a rubber duck        | Any color will do!    |
| 2    | Explain your problem     | Be detailed!          |
| 3    | Find the solution        | Reflect and debug.    |


- Forces **clarity** in thought.
- Encourages **communication**.
- Provides a sense of **companionship**.
