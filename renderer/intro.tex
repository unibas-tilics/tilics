\noindent
Studying Computer Science is like taking a deep dive into an endless
ocean of ideas, concepts, and tools. It is easy to get lost in this
wide landscape, even more so if it is not one's main field of
expertise.

This is why Computer Science students of the University of Basel set
out to identify the essential concepts and ideas they discovered
during their studies. The intention was to go beyond the scope of
traditional textbooks and also include the pecularities that are not
formally part of typical Computer Science curricula. Finally, the goal
was to present the fruit of this work to people outside of our
field. The project was organized in the form of a Master's level
seminar, which had its first iteration during the spring semester
2019.

The result is \,{\bf 2\raisebox{0.5em}{\footnotesize\artcount}\kern 2pt Things I Learned in
Computer Science}, a collection of short illustrated articles. It is
available in the form of this booklet, and online on the
companion website \,\,{\tt\color{UnibasRed} https://tilics.dmi.unibas.ch}
