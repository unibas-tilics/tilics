#### Thoughts:
- might be too technical/might not be suitable for a non-professional audience
- the topic has potential

#### Ideas:
- try and make it simpler

### 121 Orthogonality in Software
#### Thoughts:
- very interesting article
- might be a bit too complex 
- the figure did not intuitively match with the title 
- is the article about abstraction or orthogonality -> might be a bit too unclear

#### Ideas:
- explain what orthogonality means -> relate it back to geometry 
- right angle in the figure?
- figure has a good idea, but it needs to be improved, so the the idea comes across easier

- integrate metaphor better in the text

### 201 If It Works Do Not Touch It!
#### Thoughts:
- funny 
- conveys a well known message
