Decoding Syntax: The Magic of Backus-Naur Form

Imagine trying to learn a new language, like French or Python. You need to know what makes a sentence grammatically correct and what doesnâ€™t. For programming languages, we use Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to define these rules.
BNF is a way of describing the grammar of programming languages in a structured and easy-to-read format. Think of it as a blueprint that tells you how code should be written. It uses symbols and rules to show how different parts of a language fit together.

It consists of a series of production rules that describe how symbols can be combined to create valid statements. Each rule has two main components:
non-terminal symbols, which act as placeholders (like <expression>)
terminal symbols, which are the actual characters or tokens in the language (like + or 3).

A simple grammar:

expression ::= number | expression "+" number
number ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3"
