# Rubber duck debugging

Sometimes, you're just stuck on a problem that seems impossible to solve. But then as soon as you start explaining the issue to a friend, the solution suddenly becomes clear.

This is the essence of **rubber duck debugging**. In this technique, a programmer keeps an inanimate object—often a rubber duck—accompanying them at their desk. By explaining the problem aloud to the duck, they are forced to slow down and think through the issue in more detail. On many occasions, this procedure helps in finding the root cause.

The duck itself isn't magical, but it offers a convenient alternative to always needing someone to talk to whenever you encounter a bug.
