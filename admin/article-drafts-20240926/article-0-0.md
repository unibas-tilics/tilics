In computing, orthogonality refers to the independence of components in a system, where changes in one part do not affect others. This principle is essential for creating systems that are easier to design, test and extend. Though often taught indirectly, applying orthogonality explicitly leads to better system quality. A well-designed system, e.g. keeps the database code independent from the user interface, allowing changes in one without impacting the other.
