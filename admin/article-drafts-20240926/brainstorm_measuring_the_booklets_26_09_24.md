## Notes Discussion

### Law School
- Not very interesting; not a lot to relate to.
- Inside jokes; might be a good gift for people from the field.
  - Not really intended for outsiders.
- Some content feels too outlandish.

### Business School
- Accessible to laymen.
- A "teaser" for whether this is something I might consider attending.
- Useful for small talk.
- Helps understand the mindset of people in the business domain.
  - Similar concept could be cool for Computer Science.
- Structured like a philosophical article with a storyline.
- Timeless content.
- Some definitions can be boring.
- Illustrations were more like examples; sometimes you need to read the articles to understand them fully.

### Engineering School
- Examples from the field are insightful; good sampling.
- Author's note: the book is meant for students who struggle with understanding topics.
  - Short, practical illustrations help contextualize the theory.
- Having a physics or mathematical background helps, as some articles are far-fetched or too specialized.
- Potential to simplify the language; sometimes there’s too much jargon.

### Architecture
- Somewhat outlandish.
- Easy to understand, but some subtle inside jokes could be missed by laymen.
  - Authors have difficulty positioning the content toward laymen.
- Illustrations play a more important role compared to CS examples, which felt more like comics.
- Concise information.
- Author's note: there are blurry concepts in architecture, and the book fights against this with lots of examples.
- Visual representations help with understanding.
- Good length for articles, concise enough.
- Inspirational.
- Focuses on explaining concepts.

### Computer Science
- Feels like an esoteric science; not familiar with some languages used.
  - Even for people in the field, there is still value in reading the article.
- No strong storyline linking the articles together.
- Not concise.
- Issues with different graphic styles; could be more consistent.
- Cartoon style? Would adding color make sense?
- Don’t over-explain; avoid killing the joke by adding too much conclusion.
- Articles should vary in length, with shorter ones at the beginning to keep attention.
- More stylistically focused on metaphor rather than strict explanation.
- Some things can’t be easily simplified; might not be feasible to include everything in the book.
